## **SQL Queries and Analysis**  
The following queries address key business questions and analyze retail data:  

1. **Total revenue generated by each product category:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS total_revenue 
   FROM retail_sales 
   GROUP BY category 
   ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
   ```  

2. **Top 5 customers contributing the most to sales:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales 
   FROM retail_sales 
   GROUP BY customer_id 
   ORDER BY total_sales DESC 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```  

3. **Gender contributing the most to sales revenue:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT gender, SUM(total_sale) AS total_revenue 
   FROM retail_sales 
   GROUP BY gender 
   ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
   ```  

4. **Age distribution of customers purchasing products:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT age, COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customers 
   FROM retail_sales 
   GROUP BY age 
   ORDER BY total_customers DESC;
   ```  

5. **Seasonal trends in sales:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT MONTHNAME(sale_date) AS month, SUM(total_sale) AS total_revenue 
   FROM retail_sales 
   GROUP BY month 
   ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
   ```  

6. **Most profitable product category in terms of revenue and COGS:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT category, SUM(total_sale - cogs) AS total_profit 
   FROM retail_sales 
   GROUP BY category 
   ORDER BY total_profit DESC;
   ```  

7. **Best-selling month in each year based on average sales:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT year, month, avg_sale  
   FROM  
   (  
       SELECT  
           YEAR(sale_date) AS year,  
           MONTH(sale_date) AS month,  
           AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sale,  
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY YEAR(sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rn  
       FROM retail_analysis.retail_data  
       GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date)  
   ) AS t1  
   WHERE rn = 1;
   ```  

8. **Top 5 customers based on highest total sales:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales 
   FROM retail_sales 
   GROUP BY customer_id 
   ORDER BY total_sales DESC 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```  

9. **Unique customers purchasing items from each category:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers 
   FROM retail_sales 
   GROUP BY category;
   ```  

10. **Shifts and order distribution (Morning, Afternoon, Evening):**  
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       CASE 
           WHEN HOUR(sale_time) <= 12 THEN 'Morning' 
           WHEN HOUR(sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon' 
           ELSE 'Evening' 
       END AS shift, 
       COUNT(*) AS order_count 
   FROM retail_sales 
   GROUP BY shift 
   ORDER BY order_count DESC;
   ```

## **Key Insights**  
1. **Top Categories:** Clothing and Beauty products generate the most revenue.  
2. **Top Customers:** A few loyal customers contribute significantly to sales.  
3. **Gender Trends:** Gender-based insights show differences in purchasing habits.  
4. **Age Analysis:** Young adults dominate the customer base.  
5. **Seasonality:** Peak sales occur in November and December.  
6. **Profitability:** Clothing is the most profitable category after deducting costs.

## **Recommendations**  
- Focus marketing campaigns on high-revenue categories and seasonal peaks.  
- Develop loyalty programs for top customers to enhance retention.  
- Optimize stock and staffing based on time-based order patterns (e.g., Morning Shift).  
- Target younger demographics with customized offers.
